# Expanding my understanding with HTML List, JS and it's Control FLow along with CSS Box model

Graping an understanding of these three techniques and mastering when to apply them are just another method of building
my knowledge base in this ever growing coding world. It all helps me open up to new creative and inavative methods of solving problems and coming up with new ideas of helping others.

## Assignment Questions

1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document? *When you have a list of items, and they don’t have to go in any specific order.*

2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items? *By using the list style, there are several types like disc, circle and space-counter. You would activate it by typing list-style-type: (the type you want (disc; ) )*

3. When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document? *Even though both list are just that list but there is a difference. The (ol) has to be listed a certain way, the way it is by design, and if it is done out of order would disrupt the function or meaning of the list. And the (ul) can be listed in any order.*

4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list? *You can have your ordered list show in multiple ways: Lower- or Upper-case letters or lower- or upper-case Roman numeral number.*

5. Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”? *Every Box model needs some cushion for safety. A cushiony area to protect the content and one to protect the entire box. These cushions are Padding the content cushion and Margin to protect everything in the box.*

6. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.  *The HTML box model consists of Content, padding, the boarder box and Margin. Content being the area of information or data you want displayed. Padding is the cushion around the content. The border wraps around the padding and content and Margin is the white space that wraps it all.*

7. What data types can you store inside of an Array? *Various data types can be stored in Arrays Like — strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays. We can also mix data types in a single array — we do not have to limit ourselves to storing only numbers in one array, and in another only strings.*

8. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why? ( const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];): *It is not a valid Javascript array, it seems as if it is wanting to be an array inside of an array but it is not chaining the the arrays correctly with the square brackets.*

9. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.  

    * Addition Assignment (+=): Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.  

    * Subtraction Assignment (-=): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

    * Multiplication Assignment (*=): Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

    * Division Assignment (/=): Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

    * Exponentiation (**): operator returns the result of raising the first operand to the power of the second operand.

10. Read the code below and evaluate the last  expression and explain what the result would be and why.

 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;
 *The (a+c) takes precedence and will be evaluated first and b will be added afterwards.*

11. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program. *When you want a certain response or action according to the response to a question.*

12. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript. *If i want a question or a statement to repeatedly be asked or made until i get a desired response.*
