# The Web, Sites and Everything in Between

## Web Works

Websites are awesome tools used display information in many forms and able to be viewed in many places. They are created using three different elements: **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. 

* *HTML* (Hyper Text Markup Language): We use HTML to structure a web page content and get it to display in it's basic form. 

* *CSS* (Cascading Style Sheet): We use CSS after we have taken the content from HTML placed it on the page to style it. We take the content and make it more presentable, by styling it on the website.

* *JavaScript*: Is used to make the website interactive. It's a programming language that uses **Variable**, **Function** and **Class Declarations**

    * *Variables*: Variables are used to hold or declare value like numbers or text, retrieve data from them and perform operations using their values. These values may have different data types like **Strings** which is textenclosed in single or double quotes and **Numbers** that don't have the quotes.

You're able to take all of this and move it all across the world using **Http** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). *HTTP* is communication between servers and clients. This communication is done in a certain language packaged in groups of packets being transmitted across the internet using TCP/IP. You can even add pictures by taking them for the Web, right clicking on the pic and saving it to a safe place and add it to your web page.

## **HTML**

Hyper Text Markup Language, better known as *HTML* is a way that we can put content on our web page, structure it and get it to display in the order we want it to render.   
HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different areas of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.    
The **Anatomy** of HTML elements consist of an *Opening tag*, *COntent* and *CLosing tag*.

* *Opening tag*: consists of the name of the element, like p for paragraph. The p would be wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets, which marks where the element begins or starts to take effect.  

* *Content*: Is whatever information you're wanting to give.

* *Closing tag*: is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name and this marks where the element ends.

The most typical elements used in websites are *Head*, *Body*, *Main* and *Footer*

## Article vs Section Elements

An **Article element** Represents independent, self-contained content, that though it is seperate from the rest of the site it makes sense by it self.

The **Section element** is more so a generic sections of the document, a standalone section of the document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it.  

## Metadata

According to Developer.mozilla.org **Metadata** is data that describes data. For example, an HTML document is data, but HTML can also contain metadata in its <head> element that describes the document. **Search Engines** rely on *Metadata* to organize, index, and rank websites like:

* Content Discoverability: Metadata enhances content discoverability by organizing and efficiently accessing data across platforms.
* User Experience: It contributes to a seamless user experience by simplifying content discovery.
* Search Engine Algorithms: Search engines parse metadata to index content more accurately and preview it to users.
* Bridging Intent and Results: Metadata bridges the gap between search intent and relevant search results.

**Meta** HTML element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like *base*, *link*, *script*, *style* or *title*.

## Website Design

When creating a website the first thing you need to do is come to the conclusion as to what it is you are wanting to do or accomplish with the website. And that will be your main question: What do i want to accomplish? Two more questions will be: What goal am i trying to reach and What need will this site be providing?

## Semantics

**Semantics** is what is the purpose of your code, what role is it playing or effect is it having.  

One frequently used Semantic element is the **h1** which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page." Example:
<h1>This Semantic is Powerful</h1>

Another Semantic is **span** which is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. An example of this is:

Add the **basil**, **pine nuts** and **garlic** to a blender and blend into a paste.

## Javascript

**JavaScript** is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. 

Javascript needs HTML and CSS to function in the browser.
JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface, via the Document Object Model API (as mentioned above). Note that the code in your web documents is generally loaded and executed in the order it appears on the page. Errors may occur if JavaScript is loaded and run before the HTML and CSS that it is intended to modify.
